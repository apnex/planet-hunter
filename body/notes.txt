## an application as a modular heirarchical distributed system
## each pod identical instantiation, with embedded rest API
## each body has am embedded web server
## highly visual based on two.js and SVG
## stupidly lightweight <50MB containers
## need to support a 100 body system

Each body (sun, planet, moon etc..) is instantiated as a kubernetes pod
A body is anchored to a parent body
-- i.e Sun is anchored to System
-- Earth is anchored to Sun
-- Moon is anchored to Earth

A probe is launched to each body to return telemetry
-- A probe provides detailed visibility of orbited body, and its children
-- i.e the 

## VISUAL
- Simple
- Topological
- Dark theme

## STRUCTURE
- Nested
- Recursive
- Health Checks

## body
- Is a rest API

## probe
- Is a rest API

## probe registration
- probe launched

probe
- register with hub (POST)
POST /join

}

hub
- ack probe
- lodge healthcheck
- commence healthcheck endpoint
